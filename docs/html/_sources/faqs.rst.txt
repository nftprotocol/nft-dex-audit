Q: Will the multisig account ever be able to withdraw funds from the DEX that were deposited by a user through `make`?

A: No. The funds that were deposited into the DEX via `make` are protected by internal counters
and the multisig account cannot withdraw them. The multisig account can only withdraw the fees
that have been paid by the takers and assets that have been accidentally transferred to the DEX.
For example:

* A user accidentally transfers DAI to the DEX without using the `make` function.
  Then the multisig account will be able to withdraw the amount of DAI that have been transferred.
* An ERC721 contract accidentally mints an NFT with the DEX as beneficiary.
  Then the multisig account will be able to recover the NFT.
* Similar for ERC1155s.


Q: If a swap was opened with `make` and the maker lost their wallet or private key. Is there a way
to cancel the swap and recover the funds?

A: No. The swap can only be cancelled by the maker as long as they have access to their wallet or
are in possession of their private key.  If the maker loses access to their account, the swap will
remain open forever, until someone takes it, or the DEX shuts down.  If the DEX re-opens, the swap
will also re-open.
