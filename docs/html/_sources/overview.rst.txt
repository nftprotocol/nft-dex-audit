Overview

NFT DEX is a fully decentralized exchange, implemented as smart contract,
and running on the Ethereum and Polygon blockchain networks.

The DEX primarily facilitates direct swap trading of non-fungible tokens (NFTs),
such as ERC721s and ERC1155s, while at the same time it also enables trading of
fungible tokens (ERC20s) or Ether.

The DEX is fully non-custodial, and the users are in full control of their funds
at all times.

Due to its operation as a smart contract that is deployed on the blockchain,
the DEX is fully transparent, and all DEX transactions can be monitored
on Etherscan. That includes all swaps, withdrawals, and governance operations.

One of the main features of the DEX is the support of bundled swaps,
where users can define arbitrary combinations of ERC1155, ERC721, ERC20,
and Ether assets, and offer them for trading on the DEX
through one single transaction.
