Governance
##########

The DEX has a multisig administrator account that is able to perform the governance tasks.

The multisig account can be switched to a different account by the multisig account itself.


Locking and Unlocking the DEX
=============================

In emergency situations, the multisig has the capability to lock the DEX.

If the DEX is locked, no swaps can be created, traded or dropped. However, all governance functions
and withdrawal functions are still intact.

The DEX can be unlocked by the multisig account, which resumes normal operation.


Fees withdrawal
===============

The multisig account has the capability to withdraw the fees from the DEX that have been accumulated through
trading.


Recover funds
=============

The multisig account has the capability to withdraw funds that have been deposited into the DEX by accident.
That includes all asset types, ERC1155, ERC721, ERC20, and Ether.

For example, an NFT may have been minted through an ERC721 with the DEX as beneficiary.
Or an amount of ERC20 tokens may have been transferred to the DEX directly.

.. note::
    The multisig account is not able to withdraw funds that were deposited into the DEX by a user account
    through the regular swap creation method, `make`.  The contract has internal counters to protect the user funds.


Fee structure updates
=====================

The multisig account has the capability to update the fee structure by modifying the `felo` and `fehi`
thresholds, see :ref:`fee_discount`.


.. note::
    The multisig account is excluded from trading and is prohibited from creating or taking swaps.
